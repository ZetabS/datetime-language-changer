# Datetime Language Changer

Customize the language used for datetime formatting by changing moment.js's locale.

## WARNING: DO NOT DELETE or DISABLE this plugin once installed

**Please ensure the plugin remains enabled to maintain consistent language settings.**

Obsidian basically does NOT support to change internal "moment.js" locale.
As a result, I couldn't fix the bug where the locale does not change when the plugin is disabled.

## Features

- Customize the datetime language for plugins using moment.js, such as [Tasks](https://github.com/obsidian-tasks-group/obsidian-tasks).

## Installation

1. Open Obsidian.
2. Navigate to Settings → Community plugins.
3. Search for "Datetime Language Changer" and click "Install".
4. Click "Enable".

## Usage

1. Open Obsidian.
2. Navigate to Settings → Datetime Language Changer.
3. Customize locale to your preference.
